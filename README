PHOTOSHOP JAVASCRIPTS
==========================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S HERE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

optsys.jsx          - Option input/management system
utilities.jsx       - Various common functions
gradientsys.jsx     - simple gradient calculation functions

optsys-testcase.jsx - Example for optsys, and test case
gradient-toy.jsx    - Another example, used for generating various
                      repeating gradient fills

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Testcase:
Load up Photoshop.
Create a new file to work on.
Use File > Scripts > Browse ...
Select optsys-testcase.jsx
Respond to the Dialog box.
Look at your file - there's now a layer with the option values.

Gradient Toy:
Load up Photoshop.
Create a new file to work on.
Optionally select a region.
Select a foreground and background color (used by the gradient)
Use File > Scripts > Browse ...
Select gradient-toy.jsx
Respond to the Dialog box.
Wait for it to render.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTERNATIVE USE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Load up the ExtendScript Toolkit.
Load up Photoshop.
Load the Javascript of choice into ExtendScript Toolkit.
Now do whatever Photoshoppy stuff you want, but simply hit the
   "run" button in ExtendScript Toolkit when you want to run the
   script(s). This is better if you wish to run the script multiple
   times, and/or get debug output, set breakpoints, etc.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE REAL PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are designed for you to use as a basis for your own projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developed and tested using Photoshop CS5 on Mac OS X. The scripts may
need minor tweaks for other Photoshop versions or operating systems. 

These are all bits of projects that I do after a long day of coding or
otherwise fighting the forces of darkness. They are a way of relaxing and
playing. The code quality is of the "hm, that seems to work" variety,
and should not be used for anything mission critical without serious
review. Now, I have no idea what Photoshop scripts could possibly qualify
as mission critical, but I figure the above is fair warning. Just keep
in mind that I've usually had a glass or seventy of wine by the time I
get to working on these scripts.
