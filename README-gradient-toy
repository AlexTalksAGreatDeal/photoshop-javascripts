--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THE MAJOR OPTIONS MEAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gradient Patterns:
- Circles: concentric circular gradients
- Radial: radiating spokes cycling through gradient colors
- Linear: a standard directional gradient

Gradient Type:
- Stepped: one cycle of the gradient fades the foreground color to
  the background color, the next cycle fads the background color to
  the foreground color, and so on.
- Triangle Wave: Each cycle of the gradient fades the foreground color
  to the background color.
- Sine Wave: like the Stepped gradient, but the change in color
  goes as a sine wave rather than linear fade.

Number of Cycles:
- number of times to cycle between the foreground and background colors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CIRCLE GRADIENT OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Stroke width: how wide to make each band of color
- Stroke width change: how much to change the stroke width after each
  stroke is painted (in percent).

- Calculate using Full Document: center is document center, number of
  cycles computed as if the full document was being painted
or
- Calculate using Selected Region: center is selection center, number
  of cycles computed across selection

  - Fill type fit to selection: paint the largest circle that will fit
    entirely within the selection.
  or
  - Fill type fill selection: paint circle such that they will fill
    the entire selection


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
RADIAL GRADIENT OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Steps per Cycle: number of radial lines to paint in the procession from
  foreground color to background color.
- Anti-alias Mode:
  none: just paint the radial spokes
  soft: anti-aliases the spoke edges
  sharper: draws an extra line on the borders between spokes

- Calculate using Full Document: center is document center
or
- Calculate using Selected Region: center is selection center

  - Fill type fit to selection: paint the largest spoke that will fit
    entirely within the selection.
  or
  - Fill type fill selection: paint spokes such that they will fill
    the entire selection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINEAR GRADIENT OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Stroke width: how wide to make each band of color
- Stroke width change: how much to change the stroke width after each
  stroke is painted (in percent).
- Angle: direction to draw gradient (in degrees). 0 degrees is pattern
  repeating from top to bottom of screen, 90 degrees is from left to right.
